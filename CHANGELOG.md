# Changelog

All notable changes to the architecture implementation branch are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Added

- SRS-driven `tidy` package with configuration, feature-vector, pipeline, and deferred Tier 3 interfaces.
- SQLite-backed durable queue, seen index, decision history, review queue, and reversible journal.
- Atomic JSON Naive Bayes model storage, source-weighted scoring, normalized margin gate, and top-feature explanations.
- Korean morphology, bounded text/Office/PDF/archive extraction, screenshot/photo routing, local OCR, and image context features.
- YOLOv8n ONNX preprocessing, inference, NMS, object features, conjunction features, and derived geometry/count signals.
- Bootstrap learning, correction feedback, threshold calibration, collision-safe actions, dry-run behavior, and undo support.
- Evaluation metrics, resource CSV export, packaging metadata, dependency/license register, and automated tests.
- Compatibility adapter preserving the original `classify_file()` response keys.

### Changed

- The original filename/extension classifier now delegates to the new local pipeline when available.
- Project dependencies are pinned and isolated in a local virtual environment.

### Security

- Added ignore rules for local models, learned state, private evaluation corpora, databases, caches, and virtual environments.
- Preserved local-only inference and avoided bypassing TLS certificate validation.
